# Contact List React App

This is a simple contact list management application built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app allows you to view, add, and delete contacts. Each contact includes a first name, last name, and email address.

## Features

- **View Contacts:** See a table of all current contacts.
- **Add Contact:** Use the form to add a new contact to the list.
- **Delete Contact:** Remove a contact from the list with a single click.

The app uses React functional components and hooks for state management. Contact data is managed locally and can be integrated with a backend API for persistent storage.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
